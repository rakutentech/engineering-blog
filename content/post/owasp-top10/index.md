I had the opportunity to talk about OWASP Top 10 2021 at the Security Engineer MeetUp in Kyushu.
https://secmeetup.connpass.com/event/240009/

I will explain how to look at the data related to OWASP Top 10:2021 and provide detailed explanations of items with specific data. I will also introduce some of the surrounding OWASP projects. 
The presentation is mainly for people living in Kyushu but the slides will be available on Slideshare (rakutentech).
